    "Let's investigate [The Storm of the Century (1993)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Storm_of_the_Century). This storm was massive, spanning most of North America's eastern seaboard. The eastern US and Canada received record snow accumulations (50\"+ in the Blue Ridge Mountains and over 12\" at Dulles and LaGuardia), ships in the Gulf of Mexico were sunk, and Florida saw several tornadoes and 10 foot storm surges. \n",

    "The storm produced over $2 billion in damges. However, this event also was a turning point for operational forecasters who were able to identify this severe threat <b>five days</b> in advance. This was uprecedented lead time in 1993 and allowed for several states to call for a state of emergency even before snow started falling. \n",
    "\n",
    "This event shows us a textbook example of QG forcing. By examining reanalysis output, we can see very distinct regions of ascent and descent around the mature cyclone. "
